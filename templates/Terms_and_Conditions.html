        <p id="TandC">
            
            <br>THE LEGAL AGREEMENTS SET OUT BELOW ARE BETWEEN YOU (THE USER) AND NUJJ LTD AND GOVERN YOUR USE OF NUJJRECEIPT. THIS AGREEMENT APPLIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO SOFTWARE LICENCES THAT YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY ENTERED INTO. THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT AFFECT YOUR STATUTORY RIGHTS.
<br><br>NUJJRECEIPT<br>
By agreeing to and accepting these terms and conditions you agree that you have already or will immediately view the tutorial page on how to use nujjReceipt. You accept that you have carefully checked the “Tried and Tested” section of the application and will only attempt to use nujjReceipt on these shops. You agree not to copy or attempt to copy in any way the code, user interface or functionality of this application to a reasonable degree, enforceable by the courts of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. You agree to use nujjReceipt only in a personal manner and will make no attempt to self-monetise or sell on any components of the application. You agree and accept that nujjReceipt applies only to in store purchases and in no way attempts to provide receipts for online purchases. You agree to only download nujjReceipt from reputable sources sanctioned by Nujj Limited. You agree that any mistake of the application to correctly select returns dates and any subsequent inability to return items is down to you, the user and not down to Nujj Limited. Also, your failure to take an acceptable receipt photo and any subsequent inability to return items is down to you, the user. You accept that the automatic returns date selected by the application is the latest date at which you, the user can be sure to receive a full refund for the amount paid and may not necessarily be the latest date at which an exchange can be made or store credit given. It also may not be the latest date with respect to any special offers on seasonal returns. You accept that if you choose to turn off the image analyser when taking a photo of the receipt, you do so at your own risk. There are certain numbers on the receipt which the cashier may well need in processing your return, therefore you agree that in turning off the image analyser you open yourself up to the risk of these numbers not being legible, and full responsibility for this lies with you, the user.
<br><br>LIABILITIES<br>
You agree that Nujj Limited are in no way responsible for failure to use properly the application and any resulting inability to return items. You agree to take reasonable care in imaging your receipts and take full responsibility if an image is taken which is unacceptable to the shop as proof of purchase, whether the image analyser is used or not. You agree that the image analyser is included only to help you, the user take the image and is not full proof in its protection against you taking a bad image. You agree that if a shop under “Tried and Tested” refuses to accept nujjReceipt as proof of purchase Nujj Limited are not liable as this indicates differing customer service between shops and is not reasonably predictable by Nujj Limited. You agree that any breach of data privacy is down solely to the user and that Nujj Limited are not responsible for how any such data is used. You agree that any trademarks or logos imaged which are the property of shops you will not share without prior consent from the shop and in the case it is shared all responsibility lies with you, the user. You agree that Nujj Limited are in no way liable if stored receipt data is corrupted, either on a mobile’s internal data or on cloud software used, even if this leads to an inability to return items. You agree to take reasonable care in using the application and that any refusal by shops to accept nujjReceipt will be protected against by saving a physical copy of the receipt, if nujjReceipt has not already been used at that particular shop by you, the user. If this is not done you agree that no liability lies with Nujj Limited. You agree that Nujj Limited is in no way responsible if a full refund is not given if the item being returned is in any way damaged/stained or in any other non-resalable state. You accept that it is Nujj Limited’s recommendation that in order to ensure a full refund is given the item must be returned in the condition in which it was bought, or in the case of latent defect subject only to reasonable wear and tear.
<br><br>PRIVACY<br>
You agree to protect all private data collected and saved within nujjReceipt. You agree that non-personal information on your shopping habits may, in future, be analysed by Nujj Limited software and used to personalise advertisements, even if that data is collected before nujjReceipt has the ability to analyse it. You agree that no personal information will be imaged or saved using nujjReceipt software and that if it is, responsibility to protect that personal information lies solely with you, the user. You agree that any breach of privacy via nujjReceipt is down to you, the user and not Nujj Limited. Although Nujj Limited does not store your personal data, you agree that by downloading nujjReceipt you are accepting a certain degree of risk with regard to any private content you store in the application, as you would with any other, and that it is not the responsibility of Nujj Limited to warn you any further of this risk.
<br><br>USE OF CONTENT<br>
You agree to use all content for the sole purpose as set out in this paragraph. It may be used as proof of purchase to return items. It may be used to check one’s own shopping habits. nujjReceipt is not designed as proof of purchase for use with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, but may be used for this. Any attempted use of nujjReceipt for this comes at a risk that it will not be accepted. You agree to this risk and agree that Nujj Limited are in no way responsible for any rejection of a nujjReceipt in this situation. You may use the content to check prices of goods bought. You agree not to attempt to send anyone else any images of the receipt or of the bar code in any form. You accept that if you do this and are unable subsequently to return your item it is the sole responsibility of you, the user, for sharing your receipt.
<br><br>ICLOUD<br>
You agree that in the case you use iCloud storage, any agreements made within this document are without prejudice to agreements made with Apple over use of iCloud. Any breach of iCloud terms and conditions as a result of using the nujjReceipt application are the responsibility of you, the user. It is your responsibility to read the iCloud terms and conditions and ensure you will not breach them before you agree to use iCloud within the nujjReceipt application. You agree you have read the iCloud terms and conditions before agreeing to use iCloud within the nujjReceipt application. You agree that any terms of this agreement rendered void by your agreement with iCloud will not render the whole document void, only the specific section of writing in question.
<br><br>SHARING<br>
You agree only to share the content physically in using the application to return an item and agree never to copy or share any digital copies of the receipt or barcode as saved in nujjReceipt or in any other form. You agree to reasonably care for the physical copy of the receipt, whether by safe-keeping or destroying it immediately after saving a digital copy. If you destroy the receipt to safeguard against it being copied you do this knowingly with the risks of your nujjReceipt not being accepted in store, and in this situation Nujj Limited are not responsible. All points in the above paragraph apply both to itemised receipts and to debit or credit card receipts one receives or uses.

You agree that any monetary loss incurred as a result of using or intending to use or attempting to use nujjReceipt will not and cannot be passed on to Nujj Limited and will be incurred fully by you, the user. Nujj Limited agree to do all in their power to persuade any shops in which the application has been tried and tested to accept nujjReceipt universally but cannot ensure this will be the case and therefore does not accept liability for any monetary loss suffered by users. You accept that nujjReceipt are to be accepted at the discretion of the staff at the “Tried and Tested” shops. All complaints are to be directed at the individual establishments and their reasons for refusal of service to should explored thoroughly.
